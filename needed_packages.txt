    Linux Kernel-3.2
    The reason for the kernel version requirement is that we specify that version when building glibc in Chapter 5 and Chapter 8, at the recommendation of the developers. It is also required by udev.
    If the host kernel is earlier than 3.2 you will need to replace the kernel with a more up to date version. There are two ways you can go about this. First, see if your Linux vendor provides a 3.2 or later kernel package. If so, you may wish to install it. If your vendor doesn't offer an acceptable kernel package, or you would prefer not to install it, you can compile a kernel yourself. Instructions for compiling the kernel and configuring the boot loader (assuming the host uses GRUB) are located in Chapter 10.
